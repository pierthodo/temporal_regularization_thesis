Experiments to do:
Policy evaluation:
    Rewrite mixing time
    Rewrite Bias

    Rewrite Variance
    Write bias with importance sampling
    One underlining using more complex model time 
    

Control:
    Simple experiment
    One underlining using more complex model time
    Deep control with noise
    One with function approximation
    
Policy gradient method
    Simple experiment with AC
