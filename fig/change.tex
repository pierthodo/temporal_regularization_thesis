To address the first point discussed by the reviewer "lack of comparison study between different temporal regularization methods" we added 2 sets of results on the existing experiments(figure 6 and 8). The first one compares the performance of 2 temporal regularizer, the previous value and exponential smoothing. The first experiment(figure 6) on the room domain highlight the potential for complex regularizer to improve performance. The second experiment (figure 8) on the noisy walk shows that using complex regularizers can improve performance but this potential gain comes at the price of a potential loss in the case of model misfit. Tuning the lambda paramater used in exponential smoothing becomes a bias variance trade-off. It would be interesting to investigate more complex model from the time series literature in future work.
The second point mentions the existsing connection between temporal regularization and residual gradient method. Residual gradient methods effectively regularize in feature space. This differs from our approach as we do not assume any relationship in feature space. However they do share similarity in that residual gradient method will regularize in feature space based on temporal proximity along the trajectory.
The details on how PPO was extended with temporal regularization have been added to section 5.6.
We thank the reviewers for the minor suggestions. We modified the paper accordingly to fix issues like notation.
